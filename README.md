# Process_Traceability_ZF
SetCONNECT_ZF - RAC Project

## This project aims to improve internal traceability practices in commercial vehicle control systems, focusing on torque, pedal, switch states, scan date-time, and material/batch information. The dataset reveals issues, such as high variability in DBV torque 4 measurements and concerns in brake and clutch pedal parameters. Brake and clutch switch states and anomalies in scan date-time are also examined. Recommendations include investigating specific torque components, addressing pedal concerns, and analyzing switch states. The project's business value lies in improved product quality, cost savings, and enhanced customer satisfaction. The findings are data-driven, employing statistical techniques and data visualization, and consider multiple variables for a comprehensive analysis. Limitations include reliance on provided data and the need for further investigation and improvements. Despite limitations, the project concludes that corrective measures and process optimization can lead to enhanced product quality and customer satisfaction.
